In this file I have downloaded the old databases for each sport from the old site as of 10/03/2024. This is the most recent information for each of the sports. Each file has a ending that correlates to a specific sport here is the key:

*.cf = College Football
*.hsf = High School Football
*.mcb = Mens College Basketball
*.mhsb = Mens High School Basketball
*.wcb = Women's College Basketball
*.whsb = Women's High School Basketball

The one thing to mention about how I extracted the team information from the old databases, was I only did team name, team num, division id, conference id (for college sports), and state id. Where I am mapping all of that using the constants from config to access that information.

So I don't know what issues that will entail because if you look at the table sport_information_teamweeklydata, the power rankings are in there and those are associated to a team id instead of a team num. To see the team num and team id, look in the table sport_information_team, there you can find all the information for linking team id to team num.
