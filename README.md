# Packard Power Rankings


This might be an approach to our fullstack project where we can containerize the frontend and backend. I was talking to Dr. MacEvoy a little about the fullstack that uses MongoDB, and it might make more sense to switch to PostgreSQL since it can use both NoSQL and SQL databases and it works seamlessly with AWS. Here is a [template](https://github.com/PlatonovSerg/full-stack-fastapi/tree/master) that we could go off that, to me, would make the most sense and would give us the option to choose between SQL or NoSQL. Let me know what you guys think, but this swarm would give us that added boost with our development, we just need to talk to Dr. Basnet and Dr. Packard about it.
