# React Frontend

## Layout

So far I have not spent as much time on this one yet. I have to restructure the Dockerfile so that when we load into this side of things that it loads into the proper file for this portion of the application. 

With that said it still works it just takes a bit of messing around to figure out where the actual packages are in the file. Other than that it should start up in a container and we should be able to start getting files created.
