# React Frontend

## Layout

~~So far I have not spent as much time on this one yet. I have to restructure the Dockerfile so that when we load into this side of things that it loads into the proper file for this portion of the application.~~ 

~~With that said it still works it just takes a bit of messing around to figure out where the actual packages are in the file. Other than that it should start up in a container and we should be able to start getting files created.~~

This is working just fine now, and is running on the latest (I believe) version of react and all the dependencies are up-to date with the exception of a few. The container loads just fine and is ready to be used.
